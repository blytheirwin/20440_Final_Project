# **20.440 Final Project Repository**
# **Overview**
This repo is all of the code and figures generated for my 440 Project. In this repo, you will find the code writted to produce all figures in the first draft of the
440 final project write up.
All code was written by Blythe Irwin.
# **Data**
The FPKM data for common rice grown in fresh water and salt water tolerant rice grown in salt water is from Chen et al. (2017). FPKM stands for fragments per 
kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments. This data was generated by sequencing the traanscriptome and mapping the reads to transcripts. The data was 
downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102152. Rice gene family annotations were loaded from 
http://rice.uga.edu/annotation_pseudo_current.shtml.

# **Folder Structure**
In this repo, there are three folders. The first folder, "data" contains the FPKM values, annotation text file, and processed FPKM data file. The second folder, "figures" 
contains the figures outputted by the analysis. The third folder, "python_code" contains the python code used to create the figures and processed dataset.
# **Installation**
To run the code to reproduce my figures, first download the repo, with the python_code, data, and figure folders. In the /python_code folder should be a 
python file, "20440_final_project_figs_data.py". Run the code with the command "python 20440_final_project_figs_data.py" in terminal. This should output multiple bar plots.
```
python 20440_final_project_figs_data.py
```
